<p>Rather than introducing new publications ourselves, this time <a href="http://www.gi2mo.org">Gi2MO</a> is joining the effort to stimulate Idea Management research in general! We are happy to announce a <strong>Call for Papers for the Workshop on Large-Scale Idea Management &#038; Deliberation Systems (LSID 2013)</strong>.</p>
<p>Aside of publishing new achievements in the area, the primary aim of the workshop is to be a networking event to start new collaborations. Therefore, aside of typical paper presentations expect organised networking sessions and discussions.</p>
<p>Following the successful formula of the previous workshop editions, all the organisers are going to attend the event, so expect this to be a good opportunity to meet a passionate group of people who work and influence research on large-scale deliberation systems and communities.</p>

<p><strong>Held in conjunction with C&#038;T 2013 Conference in Munich, Germany, on June 29, 2013</strong></p>
<p><strong>WORKSHOP AIMS AND SCOPE</strong><br />
The workshop aims to assemble a diverse set of participants with an interest in studying or building systems for large-scale ideation and deliberation in business or civic settings. Aside of presenting new work in the area, the goal of the workshop is to enable a multi-disciplinary discussion about the key research questions and related themes underlying the design, deployment, and evaluation of LSID platforms in real world contexts. Therefore, in addition to presentations, the workshop will involve networking activities of all workshop participants in a series of organised discussions on the future developments of deliberation systems and managing collaboration for future joint projects. </p>
<p>The research issues related to workshop area can be summarised by the following problems: </p>
<ul>
<li>How can we facilitate interaction of large communities ?</li>
<li>How can we organise information stored in deliberation systems and enable to utilise this data in an efficient way?</li>
<li>How can we maintain sustainability of deliberation platforms and stimulate impact of discussions and ideas?</li>
</ul>
<p>The LSID Workshop invites researchers, engineers, software developers to present their research and works in the field of idea management and deliberation systems. Papers may deal with methods, models, case studies, practical experiences and technologies. </p>
