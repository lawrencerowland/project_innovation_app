# Innovation & Project Management App

This project contains a very small prototype of the innovation management app
outlined in the specification. It is a static client-side application that can
be served on GitHub Pages or any static web host.

## Running

Open https://lawrencerowland.github.io/project_innovation_app/webapp/index.html. Ideas entered are stored in the
browser's local storage and will persist for future visits on the same
browser.

Idea categories are loaded from `webapp/data/categories.json`. To add or
modify categories, edit that file and refresh the page.

The prototype demonstrates the basic idea submission workflow with a category
selector and listing of submitted ideas. Ideas can be filtered by category,
status or searched by keywords using the controls above the list.
