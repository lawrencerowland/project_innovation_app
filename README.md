# Innovation & Project Management App

This project contains a very small prototype of the innovation management app
outlined in the specification. It is a static client-side application that can
be served on GitHub Pages or any static web host.

## Running

Open `webapp/index.html` in a browser. Ideas entered are stored in local
storage and will persist for future visits on the same browser.

The prototype demonstrates the basic idea submission workflow with categories
and listing of submitted ideas.
